Student Management System with FirstAPI
Overview
This project is a Student Management System powered by FirstAPI. It combines machine learning (ML) for student data analysis and uses React for an interactive user interface. The system allows:

Administrators to manage student data.
Users to retrieve and view student information via a clean and responsive interface.
The backend is built with FirstAPI, connected to a PostgreSQL database, while the frontend is developed using React.

Features

RESTful API for CRUD operations on student data.
Integration with machine learning libraries to process student data and generate insights.
PostgreSQL as the database.
Frontend Features:
Dynamic and responsive user interface built with React.
Fetch and display student data from the backend API.
Interactive visualizations and tables for student performance and analysis.
